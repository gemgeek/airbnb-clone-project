# AirBnB Clone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform **Airbnb**.  
The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to:
- Browse property listings
- View detailed property information
- Complete bookings securely

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs
- Understand how to structure a complex web application
- Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture
- Gain experience working in a collaborative team environment
- Practice best practices in modern web development

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)  
**Backend:** Node.js / Express (planned)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB (planned)  
**Version Control:** Git and GitHub  
**Design Tools:** Figma  
**Deployment:** To be decided (Netlify / Vercel / Heroku)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation  
- Future folders: `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/design`  

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

### ✅ Design Goals
- Create an **intuitive booking flow** that is easy for users to follow  
- Maintain **visual consistency** across all pages  
- Ensure **fast loading times** for a smooth user experience  
- Prioritize **mobile responsiveness** (mobile-first design)  

### ⭐ Key Features
- **Property search and filtering**  
- **Detailed property viewing** with images and descriptions  
- **Secure checkout process** for bookings  
- **User authentication** (sign up / login)  

### 📄 Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays available properties in a grid layout with filters (price, location, rating). |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows complete property details with multiple images, amenities, location map, and booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined page for secure payment and booking confirmation. |

### 💡 Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.


### 🎨 Design Properties (from Figma)

#### 🎨 Color Styles
- **Primary Color:** Green (#008489)  
- **Secondary Color:** Yellow
